  |     Summary                                                             |

  |   The Main Course:                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In the main game you can play solo or work together with friends to   |
  |   complete the levels before time runs out! It doesn't stop there       |
  |   though, online leaderboards mean that it's not good enough to just    |
  |   complete when you can compete! Can you get the quickest time?         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Each level has a mechanic inspired by the film from which it takes    |
  |   its namesake. Whether avoiding sniper fire in Fry Hard or waiting     |
  |   for the ever changing seasons in Game of Cones, each level will       |
  |   force you to adapt to achieve the quickest time possible.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Recipe For Disaster!:                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   We never said this was going to be easy! Its try, try and fry again   |
  |   in Brunch Club and it is an experience of hardship, if you make a     |
  |   mistake it's game over and the level will reset! Communication,       |
  |   delegation and keeping your cool are all important to making sure     |
  |   you gain your well deserved victory.                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Who Needs Friends Anyway?:                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Whether you play solo or with friends, we've got you covered. The     |
  |   more people you have the less time you have to complete the level,    |
  |   because more people makes it easier right? We'll soon see about       |
  |   that.                                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   FACE/OFF:                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Face/off will pit 2 players against each other in quick round based   |
  |   frantic food action to see who comes out on top. Do you try and       |
  |   complete the task as quickly as possible or attempt to interrupt      |
  |   your opponent? Friendships will be torn apart as you cook, jump and   |
  |   roll your way to victory!                                             |
  |                                                                         |
